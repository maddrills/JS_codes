    //The difference between call() and bind() is that the call() sets the this keyword and executes the function immediately and it does not create a new copy of the function, while the bind() creates a copy of that function and sets the this keyword.
    //instead
    //acts kinda like super() in java
    Person.call(this,firstName,birthYear);

//reason we declared this here is because if bellow the introduce function that function will be overwriten
//because at this point student.object is empty {} to which we add introduce

const mike = new Student('Mike', 2020, 'Computer Science');

mike.calcAge(); // which is in Person class


console.log(mike instanceof Student); // true
console.log(mike instanceof Person); // true

// switching the constructer of Student to be that of student insted of the parent which happens by default

Student.prototype.constructor = Student;
console.dir(Student.prototype.constructor); // Æ’ Student(firstName, birthYear, course)
